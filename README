Todo manager with a command-line interface

Author: Xiao Jia <me@xiao-jia.com>

Dependency:
    ruby (mandatory; please install it using https://rvm.io if possible)
    git  (optional if you don't need to upload TODOs to gist)

Installation:
    gem install todo_manager

Personally, I also make an alias for the executable:
    alias t=todo_manager

Usage:
    todo_manager --help

Gist hint:
    If you use a gist url like https://gist.github.com/abc123.git
    then you have to enter your username and password every time 
    you commit (upload) you todo items.  Change it to ssh+git to 
    make this process easier: git@gist.github.com:abc123.git
