Todo manager with a command-line interface

Author: Xiao Jia <me@xiao-jia.com>

Dependency:
    ruby (mandatory; please install it using https://rvm.io if possible)
    git  (optional if you don't need to upload TODOs to gist)

Installation:
    gem install todo_manager

Personally, I also make an alias for the executable:
    alias t=todo_manager

Usage:
    todo_manager --help
